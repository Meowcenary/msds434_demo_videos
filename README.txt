NWU SPS MSDS 434 Demo Videos
---
This repo contains all the demonstration videos for MSDS 434 "Data Science and
Cloud Computing". Each video is labeled with the assignment week number. For
assignments that had multiple parts, there will be several videos for that week.
All files are in mp4 format and were recorded with the software Panopto.

It's recommended to download the files directly rather than to clone the
repository. The repository uses Git Large File Storage to track the video files,
so in order to clone the repository, you will need to install it. More details
